<p>Advanced Heliophysics is a scientific and educational organization.</p>

<p>The organization's research will focus on studying and predicting phenomena on the Sun, and how these phenomena affect military and commercial hardware on Earth and near-Earth orbit. The deliverables of this research will be:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Scientific papers in refereed journals</li>
	<li>Scientific computer programs to be made available to the scientific community</li>
	<li>Data derived directly from observations to be made available to the scientific community</li>
</ol>

<p>Advanced Heliophysics plans to recruit and involve high school and college students in its research. Each student will be assigned a small research project appropriate for their knowledge of the Sun. Through these projects, the students will learn:</p>
<ol>
	<li>How to make scientific conclusions from observational data</li>
	<li>How to use scientific solar physics programs</li>
	<li>How to write their own solar physics programs</li>
	<li>How to write academic research papers</li>
</ol>
